## Summary

We note that:
the vast majority of the use comes from subscribers 
a large part of these users are men.
In addition, many of these bikes are rented in the morning and evening during rush hours.

Two other analyses I can suggest are that it would be useful to know which stations register more bike rentals than others. 
In addition, investors would like us to extend the analysis to other months in order to obtain the overall analysis for the entire year.
